A monorepo to hold our project, similar to youtube. It's a great starting point to learn how complex technologies works. We will be adding more and more codebase to this repo over time.

> Please be aware that this repo is in development.

Some of the future features pending to implement are:

- Add job scheduling to process user uploaded videos and generate multiple resolutions from it.
- Add job scheduling and mail service to send emails to our users.
- Add Password reset functionality.
- Add job scheduling to rate videos, and classify them.
- Add more features, such as converting video to pics and download them as zip. etc. (Optional)

The overall goal of our project, will be to provide us an example of how real world large scale projects actually works and what are the complexities in creating them, scaling them and much more. So, get ready for a wonderful experience...

Thanks ,
